# Hi Steemit!  I want to choose a new place to live :)!

Here's my full list of cities:
#### Buffalo

Buffalo is simply too economically depressed for life.  While friends have told me that this is no longer the case and that the harbor is gorgeous, etc.... I think they're BSing, just like the Buffalo News does.  My family is in Buffalo, so that's a big vote in its favor.  Against it?  Well, I have no idea how the hell I'd do anything work wise and most of the city at any given moment seems to be in a weed/alcohol induced coma when not at work.  


#### Chicago

Chicago was actually a pretty decent place to live, BUT it is plagued with typical "America Problems."  It has a high rate of **violent** crime, fueled by poverty (remember the problem is always poverty-- never inequality) and the traffic is atrocious.  I don't feel like trading the sanity I've gained by being outside of the US' 


#### Rome

Io crede che parlo italiano, pero no crede che parlo bene adesso: no ho parlato italiano tra 10 anni.  Roma era una citta bella e brutta allo stesso tempo.  Credo vorrei vide una altra citta nell italia-- un anno nella Roma es abbastanza.  

#### Accra

Accra was a fantastic city in a fantastic and dynamic country.  I'm sure that there are plenty of opporrtunities in Accra and in Ghana overall.  This said, given what I have heard from some friends about the costs of living in Ghana full time as a non-Ghanian, I think I'll opt out at present.  

#### Seoul

* Sadly Korea is not a country for those who are not Korean
* See point #1 re: Seoul
* Yongsan electronics market is cool.  See point #1.  

#### Shanghai Suburbs(Technically Taicang, Jiangsu-- saying Shanghai so people know the place I'm mentioning)
* Atrocious pollution
* Let's face it: China is an exciting place to live
* Let's face it: China offers a great quality of living at a very low price
* Let's face it: Chinese e-commerce is better than e-commerce anywhere else on earth and for me that constituted a hobby that became a career.  
* Let's face it: **there's no fucking Internet access in China**

#### Shenzhen
![shenzhen-cityscape16c850.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/05/shenzhen-cityscape16c850.jpg)
* Shenzhen is the best city on planet earth
  * No, really, it is.  Deal with it.  
* I'd love to live in Shenzhen
* Let's face it: **there's no fucking Internet access in China**

#### Ho Chi Minh City
![nguyencanhdi32017.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/05/nguyencanhdi32017.jpg)
* South Vietnamese people are much more relaxed than North Vietnamese people
* If you relax, weather you're South Vietnamese or Nigerian, South Vietnamese people will artfully steal your phone
  * You will be pissed off, but at the same time amazed by the skill level
  * Try this on for size:  TWO IN A WEEK!
* Very hot and humid
* Great motorcycling outside of the urban center
* Awesome summer thunderstorms
* Internet access is so-so due to Vietnam's AAG


#### Da Nang
![danang1f2de.jpg](https://www.steemimg.com/images/2016/08/05/danang1f2de.jpg)
* Da Nang is without a doubt the most picturesque city I've ever vistited.
  * Seriously.  
* Behind Hanoi and HCMC in terms of "all things digital" 
  * Crucially for me, this includes the talent pool :(
* Internet access is so-so due to Vietnam's AAG
* I spent 2 days motorcycling in Central Vietnam.  WOW GORGEOUS!


#### Hanoi
As discussed with @rampant today.... Hanoi has some really great aspects:
* Hanoian people generally accept others at face value (and this is awesome)
* Hanoian people are future focused in that positive, practical communist way
* Hanoian startups are government-orchestrated in that negative, impractical communist way. 
* Hanoi itself is a beautiful chaos
* Traffic in Hanoi shouldn't consist of as many cars as it does.  Cars should be banned, motorcycles encouraged.  It's the only way to scale this city.  
* Air quality is so-so
* Internet access is so-so due to Vietnam's AAG

# Where should I go next?
* @rampant is headed to Ukraine, which sounds exciting, but maybe a bit too unstable?  Frankly I'll be waiting for his report.  
* @fyrstikken mentions happiness and relative freedom in Peru
* @randyclemens mentions that New Hampshire is full of like-minded folks, doing like-minded things, and smoking pot on the state capital steps (and not getting arrested, which speaks volumes of good about NH)
"OTHERRANDOMPEOPLE" Have mentioned that Chile is awesome
* @menta mentions that Cambodia is pretty great, too, but also mentioned something about a 10MBPS internet line, while I try to keep myself at a minimum of 45MBPS fiber redundant from separate ISPs converging on a single MPTCP proxy in the cloud for maximum awesome.  
* @mystictot mentions that delhi rocks, and has interesting electronics markets, which focus too heavily on imports from the manufacturing giant to the northeast.  
* "ANOTHERREALITY" is that Hong Kong is pretty great in terms of opportunity, but pretty much shattered in terms of a society.  Ask a HKer sometime.  
* @ravenzul and google confirm that the interwebs in Romania are ludicrously cheap and that nearly everyone speaks English


# What kinds of places do I consider great?
* Fastest possible internet
* Lowest possible rent while maitaining fastest possible itnernet and relatively stable electricity and connectivity
* a local tech culture
* a future oriented local culture
* awesomeness
* a general lack of regulation of people's lives, and a lack of acceptance of regulation on the part of the people

### @faddat would love to hear your advice :)!  It's an enormous and beautiful planet!
