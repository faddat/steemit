<center><h2>Absolutely everything else is at best a trivial distraction, and at worst a sickening waste of resources that should be otherwise allocated</h2></center>
<center><h4>Therefore</h4></center>
<center><h2>People who give a fuck, who will eventually matter with respect to the quality of human existence, should choose a piece of the journey to "Star Trek" and push for it with all they've got.</h2></center>

Yes, I'm talking about the TV show.  And no, I'm not talking about the fights with aliens, and planet-hopping, or even warp drive.  I'm talking about a world with limitless economic potential.  And... while you've been propaganized not to believe this for your entire life and we're conditioned by both our biology and our society to think in a scarcity mindset, we are SO FUCKING CLOSE.  My mental arithmeatic on this topic goes like this:

(Technology Development A) * (Technology Development B) = Technology Development C-E
C * A = 1-50
C * B = 51-100
D * C = 101-150
E * A = 151-200

Now, it doesn't actually work like that.  In fact, we've entered an era where discoveries don't really stand on their own-- each individual new technology or discovery rests upon literally hundreds of others and very often opens the door to thousands of others subsequently.  

## Steemit
That's the holy thing going on there at Steemit, by the way-- independent actors are getting money to pursue their little piece of the future.  I don't want to get freaky here but it's perfectly possible that Steemit will one day be in history books because it is indeed a totally new type of economy.  I know that every day, a little birdie in my brain goes "holy shit, I should thank @officialfuzzy" for introducing me to steemit!  Then I realize I've already done that about ten times.  Folks, here we get paid directly for ideas, and we don't have to bend over backwards for the privilege.  This is NOT like previous centuries.  This is something totally new and of course that's why it is so infectious.  

## How I got started on such a crazy mission
Really, it all started because I gave a shit.  It was nothing more or less than that.  Specifically, I gave a shit about a really special class of students that I taught.  For whatever reason, they got me thinking about the future, and frequently, I liked to imagine that it was a really great future.  One day, I stumbled upon [Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds](https://globaltrends2030.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/global-trends-2030-november2012.pdf), and it changed my life.  I still remember clearly, running through the entire 123 pages entirely rapt.
